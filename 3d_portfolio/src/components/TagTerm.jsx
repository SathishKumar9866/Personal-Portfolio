   PLAIN ENGLISH.

   One tool chip — "PySpark", "Docker", "RAG" — wherever it appears on the page.

   It does three jobs: shows the tool's logo if one exists, explains the term in
   plain English when you hover or tap it, and stays a 44px touch target on a
   phone while looking like ordinary text.

   The logos are the interesting part. All 41 marks together are ~17 kB
   gzipped, which is a lot to pay at first paint for decoration, so they live in
   a separate file fetched the first time any chip mounts. One module-level
   cache and a set of waiting callbacks means 33 chips share a single download
   rather than triggering 33.

   Walked through slowly: docs/LEARNING-NOTES.md, sections 2 and 5.

/**
 * Owns: one technology chip, and the plain-English definition behind it.
 *
 * Two chips, two jobs:
 *  - In Stack the chip TEACHES, so the definition opens on hover as well as on
 *    click. A reader scanning tools should not have to guess that a chip is
 *    clickable to find out what it means.
 *  - On project and experience cards (`plain`) the chip STATES. There the
 *    expanded name is a native tooltip, so a definition panel never opens inside
 *    a tilting card or competes with the card's own links.
 *
 * Whether a definition exists is signalled by a dotted underline on the word,
 * the long-standing convention: not a dashed box and a "?" on every chip. The
 * underline goes solid on hover and focus, so the affordance confirms itself
 * before the reader commits to a click.
 *
 * Two tiers, set by `primary`. A group's headline tools get a filled chip,
 * everything else stays outline. The fill inverts per theme rather than being
 * dark in both: a dark fill on the dark ground would read as less emphasis, not
 * more. On hover a filled chip goes to an accent fill with --c-strong ink,
 * which is the one accent pairing that clears AA (4.68:1); accent-ink text on
 * the fill would not.
 */
/**
 * The marks arrive in their own chunk, fetched once on first mount.
 *
 * 25 brand paths are 32kB of path data — +17kB gzipped on an entry bundle of
 * 33kB, which is a 50% tax on first paint for decoration. Loaded this way the
 * entry bundle does not move at all and the glyphs appear a frame or two after
 * the chips they sit in, below the fold, where nobody is looking yet.
 *
 * One module-level cache and one subscriber set, not a context: every chip on
 * the page wants the same object, and a provider around them would re-render
 * all 33 of them to deliver it.

 * tracks the chip's font size, including the reader's own text-size control,
 * and painted in `currentColor` rather than the brand hex — thirty coloured
 * logos in one section is the badge wall this section's first sentence argues
 * against ("Not a badge collection"). At 0.85 opacity the glyph sits under the
 * word rather than competing with it.
 *
 * A term with no mark renders nothing here. Concepts (RAG, MLOps, Evaluation)
 * have no logo, and two of the products named — Azure, DynamoDB, S3, Pinecone —
 * are simply absent from simple-icons. A stand-in glyph would be decoration
 * pretending to be information.
