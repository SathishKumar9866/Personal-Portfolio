# Feature backlog

Future work for the portfolio, as tickets. Priority: **P0** ship-blockers,
**P1** high-value, **P2** nice-to-have. Effort: S / M / L. Status: `[ ]` todo,
`[~]` needs input, `[x]` done.

> Current state (2026-09-15): live at <https://sathishkumarai.github.io/>, built
> from `main`, deployed and verified by bundle hash. Six palettes with **Paper as
> the default**, reader-controlled text size, full-bleed scenes, a sticky Roles
> deck, a WebGL hero field on desktop, tool logos on every named technology, and
> an ask box that retrieves from the page's own copy.
> Twenty-one PRs squash-merged 2026-09-14 and 2026-09-15; `npm test` is 27 checks
> in CI.
> See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Next up, in order of value (added 2026-09-15)

The four below are the whole of what is worth doing next. Everything after them in
this file is older and lower-value; if you only have an afternoon, it is the first
one.

- [ ] **(P0, S) Open the live site in Safari, Firefox and on a real iPhone.**
  Overdue rather than prudent. The deployed page now leans on `color-mix` for
  every scene ground, `@property` for the travelling role-edge light, WebGL for
  the hero, and `position: sticky` for the Roles deck — **and none of it has ever
  been opened outside Chrome, by anyone.** The hide-on-scroll handler also clamps
  scroll position for iOS rubber-banding and that code has never executed on an
  iPhone. Check in this order: scene grounds and hairlines, the role-edge light
  (it should fall back to a static tinted border where `@property` is missing),
  deck pinning and covered-card dimming, the WebGL field and its 2D fallback, the
  ask box, the six palettes. *Plane: `COD-194`.*
- [~] **(P1, L) Campaign act 3: projects as product pages.** Full-bleed cover art,
  a spec row beneath it, the diagram as hero rather than thumbnail. **Blocked on
  the owner:** a software campaign leads with the product and this repo has never
  had a single screenshot. Three would change the shape of the work entirely.
  *Plane: `COD-195`.*
- [ ] **(P1, M) Campaign act 4: scroll choreography.** Pinned scenes and type that
  arrives as you enter one. The Roles deck is the pattern; generalising it is the
  work. Nothing blocks this — `Reveal.jsx` and the scene structure already exist.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Campaign act 5: a persistent CTA.** One "open to roles" bar that
  follows the reader instead of a single button in the hero. Small, and worth
  doing after act 4 so it does not fight the scene transitions.

### Done 2026-09-15

- [x] **~~Regenerate `og.png`.~~** It had been previewing a tagline the site no
  longer had. The template is now guarded by a test that fails if it stops
  naming the current role; the render stays manual.
- [x] **~~Guard the JSON-LD and `<noscript>` mirrors.~~** `html-mirror.test.mjs`,
  7 checks, proved to fail three ways.
- [x] **~~Trim the font subsets.~~** 20 woff2 files to 12, vendor CSS 12 kB to
  6.56. Reader transfer is unchanged — the claim that this was worth ~90 kB was
  wrong, and the measurements are in the WORKLOG.

### Found 2026-09-15, measured on the live page

Lighthouse mobile is 100 across accessibility, best practices, SEO and agentic
browsing, so these are what that score cannot see.

- [x] **~~(P1, M) The phone page grew back.~~** Fixed the same day: 9,825px ->
  **8,249px at 390x844, 9.8 screens**, the shortest it has ever been. The
  previous conclusion — "anything further means cutting what is shown" — turned
  out to be a false choice: a disclosure shows less without cutting anything.
  See the WORKLOG entry for 2026-09-15.
- [ ] **(P2, S) `CodeCompletion.jsx` is 515 lines**, past the workspace 500-line
  ceiling; `Works.jsx` is 498, at it. Split by concern, not by line count.

### Done 2026-09-15 (second pass)

- [x] **~~Name the five scene regions.~~** They were five unnamed `region`s in the
  landmark list. `SectionHead` ids its own `<h2>`; `SectionWrapper` points
  `aria-labelledby` at it, so the name is the heading.
- [x] **~~Strip the stage numeral from the Stack group names.~~** The mobile
  variant had the index *inside* the `<h3>`: `heading "Data engineering01"`.
- [x] **~~Nest the degrees under Education.~~** They render through `Role`, so they
  were `h3` beside their own `h3` group heading. `Role` takes `as` now.
- [x] **~~Fix the docs that described the deleted spec band.~~** Five places,
  including the repo README's first sentence and a learning-notes example
  pointing at a file that no longer exists.

### Smaller things worth doing, none of them blocking

- [x] **~~(P2, S) A per-project anchor.~~** Done 2026-09-15, because the phone
  limit made it urgent: About cites `pb-card-deck`, the sixth project, which a
  phone hides. Each card is `id={name}`, About links to it, and a deep link to a
  hidden card opens the deck first. The ask box still links to `#projects`.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Tighten the `llms.txt` guard to whole words.** It matches
  substrings, so renaming `pb-card-deck` to `pb-card-deck-OLD` *in the file* slips
  through. The direction that actually drifts is caught; this closes the other one.
- [ ] **(P2, M) Give `Experience.jsx` a name that matches its section.** The
  section is Roles; the file is still `Experience.jsx`. A rename touches the HOC
  call, the components README and four imports — cheap, but it is a rename, so do
  it deliberately rather than as a tidy-up.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Drop `react-tilt`.** One dependency for an 8° hover tilt on project
  cards that is already disabled under reduced motion. A dozen lines of CSS
  `transform` on pointer position would replace it.
- [ ] **(P2, M) A contrast check in CI.** `TYPE-AUDIT.md` was measured by hand
  once. The six palettes × the elements that matter is a script, and it would have
  caught the one real finding in that audit before it shipped.

## Ship / deploy

- [x] **(P0, S) ~~Push branch + open PR.~~** Done 2026-09-11, squash-merged 2026-09-12 as `630a38f`, branch deleted.
- [~] **(P0, M) Deploy to Vercel.** Zero-config for this Vite app. Yields the
  production URL that unblocks the tickets below. *Blocked 2026-09-11:
  `npx vercel whoami` returns `Logged out` and `vercel login` is interactive, so
  it has to be run by the owner. Deploy from the subdirectory
  (`npx vercel --cwd 3d_portfolio`) or set Root Directory to `3d_portfolio` if
  importing the repo in the dashboard: the site is not at the repo root.*
- [x] **(P0, S) ~~Set the real canonical domain.~~** Done 2026-09-11:
  <https://sathishkumarai.github.io/>. The canonical, `og:url`, `og:image`,
  `twitter:image` and the JSON-LD `url`/`image` are the only place the domain is
  hard-coded, and `index.html` says so, so moving to a Vercel address later is
  those lines and nothing else.
- [x] **(P0, M) ~~Deploy to GitHub Pages.~~** Done 2026-09-11: live at
  <https://sathishkumarai.github.io/>, built by Actions in the
  `SathishKumarAI.github.io` repo, which holds no site code. That repo name is
  load-bearing: only `<user>.github.io` serves from the domain root, which keeps
  Vite's `base` at `/` so one build serves both Pages and Vercel.
- [x] **(P0, S) ~~Flip `SOURCE_REF` to `main`.~~** Done 2026-09-12, in the same
  pass as the merge. Pages builds from `main`.
- [x] **(P1, M) ~~Repository protection.~~** Done 2026-09-12: 28 public repos
  refuse force-push and branch deletion and require linear history. 23 private
  repos blocked by plan, 9 forks skipped on purpose. Reasoning, including why an
  enforced PR workflow would lock the owner out on a personal account, is in
  `../../docs/REPO-SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Protect the 23 private repos**, which needs GitHub Pro. Or
  decide they do not need it: a private repo is visible only to its owner, so
  the accidental-force-push risk is his alone.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Protect the 9 forks**, if the *Sync fork* button is the only way
  they ever get updated. Skipped because blocking force-push breaks the
  hard-reset-onto-upstream way of syncing one.
- [x] **(P1, S) ~~`sitemap.xml`~~** Declined 2026-09-11, reasoning recorded in
  `public/robots.txt`: this is a single page with in-page anchors, so a sitemap
  would carry exactly one URL and tell a crawler nothing it does not already
  have. Reopen the day the site grows real routes.
- [~] **(P1, M) Cross-browser + real-device QA.** Partly done 2026-09-12: the
  owner checked a real phone and it immediately found what nine emulated
  viewports could not — the hero code band flickered, because a mobile browser
  collapses its URL bar as you scroll and the hero is a viewport-height box.
  Fixed. **Safari and Firefox are still completely untested**, and the
  hide-on-scroll handler's iOS rubber-band clamp has still never run on an
  iPhone. This stays the biggest gap on the board.

## Content the owner must supply

- [~] **(P1, M) Real project screenshots / GIFs (option A).** Drop images into
  `public/`; layer them over the generative covers for the top 1, 2 projects.
  Highest credibility. *Needs assets from Sathish.*
- [x] **(P1, S) ~~Add EmailJS keys.~~** Dropped 2026-09-11, the contact form
  was removed in favour of a copyable address and an icon row, so there is
  nothing left to key.
- [x] **(P1, S) ~~Confirm LinkedIn slug + contact email.~~** Done 2026-09-11: canonical slug is lowercase `sathishkumarai`, from the owner's own saved profile (72 occurrences, zero for mixed case). HTTP cannot settle it; LinkedIn answers both with 999. Original note: are current (LinkedIn
  blocks bot verification; email deliverability untestable here).
- [~] **(P2, M) Metric covers (option E).** Show a real chart per project
  (retrieval recall, detection mAP, latency). *Needs real numbers: don't fake.*
- [~] **(P2, S) Testimonials.** *Needs real quotes.*

## Features

- [ ] **(P1, L) Per-project detail pages / modals.** problem → approach → result,
  with the "what made it hard" line. Deep dive for recruiters who click in.
- [ ] **(P2, M) Live iframe embed (option D)** for `pickleball-shuffle` (it's live).
- [ ] **(P2, L) Writing / blog section.** Short posts on shipping ML to prod, reinforces the hero thesis.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Résumé / CV download** button in the hero or footer.
- [ ] **(P2, S) "Now" / current-focus line**, what he's building this month.
- [ ] **(P2, M) Hover-reveal on Stack tools**, where each tool was used (link to
  the project that uses it).
- [x] **(P2, S) ~~Rotating / more quotes.~~** Cancelled 2026-09-11: the three interstitial quotes were removed. They were the largest type on the page after the h1, larger than any project title, and sat between the reader and the work.

## Polish

- [x] **(P1, S) ~~Light-mode contrast audit.~~** Done 2026-09-11: the accent's role was split rather than its colour changed. `--c-accent` fills, `--c-accent-ink` reads as text. 22 pairs measured from the built stylesheet, all AA in both themes. Small red text (`#FF3621`) on white
  is ~3.5:1: fine for large headings (AA large), below AA for small body/eyebrow
  text. Consider a darker red token for small text, or navy.
- [x] **(P2, S) ~~Smooth theme transition.~~** Done 2026-09-12. Scoped to the
  moment of the change rather than left on: `.theme-switching` is added to
  `<html>` when the theme changes and removed 260ms later, so the other 99% of
  the session carries no global colour transition — one left on permanently
  would also animate every hover, every active nav link and every reveal. Two
  details that matter: the effect skips its first run, or every reader would
  watch the page assemble its own colours on load; and the reduced-motion
  override is placed AFTER the fade, because the global reset near the top of
  index.css is `!important` too and between two equally important, equally
  specific rules the later one wins.
- [x] **(P2, M) ~~OG / Twitter share image.~~** Done 2026-09-11: `public/og.png`
  at 1200x630 plus 180/192/512 icons. Regenerated later the same day when the
  title changed, and given a source: `docs/og-card.html`. It had none, so the
  card kept saying "ML / AI Engineer" after every string on the site had been
  updated, because a grep cannot read a PNG. Still needs absolute URLs at deploy.
- [x] **(P1, M) ~~Legibility / type-size audit.~~** Done 2026-09-11: the page was
  typeset as a dashboard, 137 text elements at 10-11px including every fact a
  recruiter came for. Replaced sixty-four size literals with a named scale in
  `tailwind.config.js`. Two contrast failures fixed (logo monogram 3.62:1, footer
  separator 1.33:1) and three sub-44px touch targets. Full reasoning and
  measurements in `docs/TYPE-AUDIT.md`.
- [x] **~~(P1, M) Shorten the phone page further.~~** 14,494px -> 10,520px ->
  8,967px (2026-09-12) -> 9,825px as campaign copy landed -> **8,249px on
  2026-09-15**, 9.8 screens at 390x844. The first two rounds were deletions: the
  six About capability cards (-480px, they restated Stack) and the Stack chips
  losing their boxes (-233px). The third was not — nothing was deleted. See the
  WORKLOG for why the "anything further means cutting what is shown" conclusion
  recorded here was wrong.
- [ ] **(P2, S) A theme picker on first load** was proposed and advised against:
  the site already reads `prefers-color-scheme`, so a modal asks a question the
  OS has answered and puts a decision between a recruiter and the content. If it
  is still wanted, build it as an inline strip in the hero, not a dialog.
- [x] **(P2, S) ~~Delete `Quote.jsx`.~~** Done 2026-09-12. Dead since the
  interstitial quotations were removed. Confirmed before deleting: no reference
  anywhere in `src/`, and the built bundle contained zero occurrences of its
  `figcaption` — Rollup had already tree-shaken it, so the deletion changes the
  shipped output not at all and is purely about the reader of the source.
- [x] **(P2, S) ~~Section-header treatment.~~** Done 2026-09-12: the eyebrow now
  carries a derived fact (`4 roles · since 2020`, `6 areas · 33 tools`,
  `6 built · 1 live`, `4 routes · US Central`) instead of a label that repeated
  the nav, and the trailing full stops are gone. `SectionHead.jsx` owns the
  shape. Every number is computed from the data, so none can go stale.

## Engineering

- [ ] **(P2, M) Reduce framer-motion footprint**, it's the largest runtime dep
  (~37KB gzip). Replace simple reveals/hovers with CSS where possible.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Preload the primary font weights** (Barlow 400/700) to cut FOUT.
- [x] **(P2, S) ~~CI: build + lint on PRs.~~** Done 2026-09-12,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Runs the same install / lint / build / crawler-file
  guard the deploy runs, on the same Node 22, so CI and deploy cannot disagree
  about what green means. A Lighthouse budget was **not** included: it needs a
  hosted URL per PR to be meaningful, and this repo has no preview deploys.
  Reopen it if Vercel previews ever land.
- [ ] **(P1, L) Prerender for AI crawlers.** The site is a client-rendered SPA,
  so ChatGPT-User, GPTBot and most AI crawlers see only the `<noscript>` block:
  they do not execute JavaScript. `public/llms.txt` is the deliberate answer and
  covers the content, but the HTML itself is empty to them. A build-time
  prerender (one plugin, one build step) would give them the real page. Weigh
  against the cost of a new dep and a second render path. This is a
  rearchitecture, not a refinement, which is why it was flagged rather than
  started.
- [ ] **(P2, S) Keep `llms.txt` and the JSON-LD honest.** Both are hand-written
  copies of facts that live in `src/constants/index.js`, and both now carry a
  comment naming the constant they mirror. A small check that fails when
  `stackGroups` or `education` drifts from them would make the comment
  enforceable instead of aspirational.
